### General Info
This project was great for practicing working with htmls audio api, and using the audi tag. The JavaScript was pretty simple. I created an array that consisted the id of each sound. I used a forEach loop with an event listener on each button to generate the sound with the .play method. I also added a function for resetting each sound to their original state.
